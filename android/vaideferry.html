    </ul>

    <h2>Why We Collect Data & Legal Bases</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Provide and operate the app:</strong> Necessary to deliver features and functionality.</li>
        <li><strong>Improve the app:</strong> Use analytics and crash logs to diagnose issues and enhance usability.</li>
        <li><strong>Communicate with you:</strong> Respond to support requests and send important updates (with your consent for marketing messages where required).</li>
        <li><strong>Compliance and safety:</strong> Prevent abuse, comply with legal obligations, and protect user safety.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How We Share Data</h2>
    <p>We may share data with:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Service providers and subprocessors (hosting, analytics, crash reporting, maps)</li>
        <li>Legal authorities when required by law</li>
        <li>Acquirers or partners if the business or app is sold or merged (with notice)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Third-party SDKs integrated in the app (for example Google/Firebase services, Maps) may collect data independently; review their privacy policies for details.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services Used</h2>
    <p>Examples of services we may use: Google Play services (Maps, Analytics, Crashlytics), Firebase, and other libraries. These providers process data as independent controllers or processors and publish their own privacy terms.</p>

    <h2>Data Retention</h2>
    <p>We retain data only as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes described or to comply with legal obligations. Aggregated or anonymized data may be kept indefinitely for analytics.</p>

    <h2>International Transfers</h2>
    <p>Data may be processed and stored in countries other than your own. We take contractual and technical safeguards where required, but transfers may be subject to the laws of the destination country.</p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>We implement commercially reasonable security measures to protect data. No method of transmission or storage is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

    <h2>Your Rights</h2>
    <p>Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have rights including access, correction, deletion, portability, restriction of processing, and objection. To exercise these rights, contact us at <a href="mailto:vaideferru@danielfilho.com">vaideferru@danielfilho.com</a>. We may need to verify your identity before honoring requests.</p>

    <h2>Choices & Opt-Outs</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Analytics:</strong> You may opt out of analytics collection where supported by the SDK or by using device-level settings.</li>
        <li><strong>Location:</strong> Grant or revoke location permissions through your device settings; disabling location will limit location-based features.</li>
        <li><strong>Push notifications:</strong> You can disable push notifications in your device settings.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>The app is not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe we have collected data from a child, contact us to request removal.</p>

    <h2>Automated Decision Making</h2>
    <p>We do not use automated profiling or make significant automated decisions about users that produce legal effects. If this changes, we will disclose relevant information.</p>

    <h2>Links to Other Sites</h2>
    <p>The app may contain links to third-party websites or services. We are not responsible for their privacy practices.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
